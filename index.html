					<p>I am passionate about education and inspiring a love of science and curiosity about the natural world in people of all ages. My personal research interests lie in understanding the biomechanical and physiological mechanisms underlying the movement of animals.  Specifically, I am interested in muscle function and how it is affected by ecological demands placed on it.  I use an integrative approach, which bridges the fields of functional morphology, ecophysiology, comparative biomechanics, and evolution to provide an essential, mechanistic-driven approach to understanding the physiological and ecomorphological mechanisms underlying both aquatic and terrestrial systems. I am also interested in how modern statistical tools (e.g. machine learning methods) can not only help detect and quantify coordination of limbs and muscles, but also classify discrete locomotor behaviors. </p></font>

				<p>My research program examines the morphological and physiological mechanisms underlying ecological communities and the role that factors both intrinsic and extrinsic to muscle function play in shaping the evolution of complex species-environment interactions. Muscles, the primary drivers of locomotor behaviors, are complex, hierarchical structures whose ultimate function and performance is defined by the integration of intrinsic suites of morphological and physiological factors with extrinsic factors of other muscles and systems within the body. Further, they power locomotion within the context of highly heterogeneous environments. By integrating hierarchies of data collected across morphological, biomechanical, physiological, and ecological disciplines, we can gain a powerful understanding of the mechanisms underlying behavioral specializations, the limits to conditions where muscles can be effective, and the mechanisms by which muscles become better at performing a behavior or handling novel environmental challenges. </p>

				<ol> <li> <b>Subtle ecomorphological systems</b> – Subtle ecological challenges involved in shaping ecomorphological systems, such as those exemplified by skinks and Caribbean <i>Anolis</i> lizards, can be useful in characterizing the role of biomechanics in shaping ecological communities. Building on my previous work in skinks and <i>Anolis</i> lizards, we use a comparative approach to examine the role of muscle morphology, activation patterns, and contractile properties in shaping the ecomorph structure in <i>Anolis</i> lizards.
				</li>
				<br />
				<li> <b>Functional Morphology and Biomechanics through Ontogeny</b> – Juveniles of many species often encounter significantly higher predation pressure because they are smaller, cannot escape as quickly, are more clumsy, and lack both the experience and ability to compete with adults for the more preferable, safer habitats.  These challenges make rapid growth a desirable and beneficial trait in many species. However, it is unclear how morphology, physiology, and locomotor performance change through development and what mechanisms help juvenile lizards successfully perform locomotor behaviors through the most vulnerable life stages. Our lab, in collaboration with Prof. Selvitella, a mathematician/ statistician (Purdue University Fort Wayne), aims to address this gap by applying time series methods to morphological and biomechanics datasets collected repeatedly through development in lizards.
				</li>
				<br />
				<li> <b>Mathematical modeling of neuromuscular control</b> – I have recently become interested in the use of machine learning methods (e.g. neural networks) to hypothesize and test links between disparate but related datasets. In particular, my lab investigates the strength of the relationship between neuromechanical control and locomotion by attempting to predict a landscape of potential neuromuscular signals from observed locomotor behaviors. This work, in collaboration with Prof. Selvitella, may have a large impact in the field by providing concrete, testable hypotheses to direct future research.

		<font style="font-family: 'Lustria', serif; font-size: 24px"> Undergraduate Students</font>
		<p> Our lab is always looking for enthusiastic undergraduate volunteers. Students start by helping to look after the animals, which is a great way to get to know how we run things and see the research that is going on in the lab. As students gain experience and as their interest builds in the research going on in the lab, there may be opportunities to be more directly involved in research projects, sign up for research credits, and/or complete an Honors Theses.</p>
		<p> <b>Expectations:</b> The amount of time spent in the lab will vary on a case-by-case basis, depending on student availability and responsibilities.  However, to get the most out of the opportunity, a minimum of 3 hours per week is recommended. </p>
		<p> Interested students should contact <a href="mailto:klfoster@bsu.edu" target="_blank">Dr. Kathleen Foster</a> directly with unofficial transcripts, a brief CV/resume, and a description of why they are interested in the lab and what they hope to get out of their experience in the lab. Please write "Ecological and Comparative Biomechanics Lab" in the subject line of your email.</p>

		<p> Prospective graduate students must contact the PI (<a href="mailto:klfoster@bsu.edu" target="_blank">klfoster@bsu.edu</a>) to discuss their interest in applying to the lab.  In your email, include the following information: </p>
